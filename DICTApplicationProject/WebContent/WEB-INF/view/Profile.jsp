	<h1>Creator's Profile</h1>
	<h2>Anthony Matthew L. Deco</h2>
	<p>	I am a freelance programmer with knowledge in Java, C#, .NET and Web Development (HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS).
	<br/>My main focus in programming is in Android Development. I coded apps using Java &amp; XML in Android Studio, as well as C# &amp; XAML in Xamarin Studio.
	<br/>Examples of mobile apps I have created were a university app for my Alma Mater, TUP-Manila, called TUPAPP, an advertising-centered mobile app for a transport
	<br/>company called Star8, and a simple flashlight app for my phone since I haven't got the torch function from new Samsung devices.
	<br/>
	<br/>	Despite having knowledge in Android, I also have a background in Web Development as I have coded client-side HTML as well as client-side PHP.
	<br/>Throughout my specialized industrial training, I worked with a company called Fourth Shift Global to create a web application that outsources
	<br/>call center agents through online cloud computing.
	<br/>
	<br/>	Lastly, in spite of development of this web application, I have no experience in this framework but as it seems, I have learned only the basics in a
	<br/>matter of 3 days. Thus, creating a full head-on, MVC-structured web framework was too much for me to handle. But nevertheless, I can accomplish
	<br/>the task given to me if the given time was sufficient. 
	<br/>
	<br/>I could not complete the task you have given upon me but I can easily learn about it need the worry arises.
